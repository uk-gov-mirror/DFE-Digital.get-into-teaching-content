I always wanted to teach, I wanted to instil a love of languages in young people, but I also knew I didn’t have to pursue that ambition straight after graduating. I worked for 4 years in an investment bank before training to teach.

I have always loved languages and have seen first-hand how they open doors – both from a personal, and professional point of view. Learning and teaching languages is also really good fun and I get a real buzz when my students are able to express themselves.

> I get a real buzz from teaching.

It’s amazing when I walk around school and hear my top-set year 7s chatting to each other in Spanish and debating the correct adjective agreement!

I did extensive research to make sure that I was training somewhere where I would be a ‘good fit’ and that had a great reputation for training.

I also thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to participate in a wide range of school activities and would recommend others do the same.

Get involved in everything that you can, shadow a key stage you don’t teach, observe teachers outside of your department, be in the staff Christmas panto, or help out on a school trip.

It sometimes feels like you have no spare time, but when you are in training is when you have the most opportunities.

And get as much feedback as you can, from as many people as you can, and learn from it.
