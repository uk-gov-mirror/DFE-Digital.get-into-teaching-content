I graduated with a BSc in sport and human movement studies, and then went on to achieve Master's degrees in sports biomechanics and exercise nutrition science. I had a career in the police force and feel this has shaped who I am as a teacher.

> As a qualified coach, I particularly enjoy the overwhelming satisfaction I get when a child I've been teaching has mastered a skill.

During my time as a police officer, I built my communication skills effectively and have been able to bring them into the classroom. It gave me the understanding that some children do not have the ideal home life.

I'm really keen to promote the importance of PE both in school and in everyday life, and away from sport, I want children to see the importance of subjects like maths and not to be afraid of it.
