                After 6 years of working in the world of recruitment consultancy, I felt it was time for a new career.
            </p>
<p>I had 2 degrees: Master’s merit in management and a degree in geography, so I was thinking of teaching either business or geography.
</p>
<p>However, after some hard thinking, my real passion lay in teaching geography. In addition, it was clear to me that geography is becoming a subject that will rise in importance and be in far more demand over the next decade.

                    <span class="icon-quote"></span>
                    <h1>Now 4 years into my teaching career, I haven’t looked back – I was head of year 18 months after qualifying as a teacher, and a year later promoted to head of department.
<span class="icon-quote quote-close"></span></h1>
           </div>
               <p>I was working away a lot and spending less and less time with my family. This was another reason I decided to investigate a career in teaching.                
	</p>
            </div>
            <p>I had some initial reservations about starting a new career, particularly the financial implications. It was a huge consideration – but offset by having access to a bursary. Without a bursary, I would still be in my old career. I simply wouldn’t have been able to maintain my rent and loans, and pay university fees without it.
            </p>
	<p>With yearly performance reviews, you have the opportunity to highlight your skills and the positive impact you’ve had on your school. In this review, I double jumped up the pay range and with extra responsibilities you can 			achieve additional increases to your salary.
	</p>
	 <p>It’s a privilege to play a big part in a young person’s life. A good teacher is crucial to a young person’s development. Let’s face it; we all have at least one story of our favourite teacher going above and beyond to help us 		when we were at school.
