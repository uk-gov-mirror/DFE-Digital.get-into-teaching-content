  <p class="content-alert">You can apply for a tuition fee loan to pay for your training so you don't need to pay anything upfront. You can also apply for a maintenance loan to help with living costs and you may be able to get a bursary or a scholarship. </p>
  
  <h2 id="bursaries-and-scholarships">Bursaries and scholarships</h2>
  <p>Bursaries and scholarships are tax-free amounts of money to train in certain subjects. You don’t need to pay them back.</p>
  
 <p>You’ll need a first, 2:1, 2:2 degree or a PhD or Master's to be eligible for a bursary.</p>
 <p>For a scholarship, each professional scholarship body sets its own criteria.</p>
 <p>You could get a bursary of up to £24,000 or apply for a scholarship of up to £26,000.</p>

  <h2 id="get-student-finance">Tuition fee and maintenance loans</h2>
  <p>Even if a bursary or scholarship is available for your course, you can get student finance to cover your fees and help with your living costs. You can apply for a tuition fee and/or a maintenance loan even if you already have a student loan.</p>

  <p>You can apply for a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 to cover the full cost of your course fees and a maintenance loan of up to £12,010 to help with your living costs.</p>
  
 <p>You will only have to make repayments when you're earning. Your repayments will not increase if you already have a student loan and take a loan out for teacher training.</p>
