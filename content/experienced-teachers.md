## Getting qualified

If you taught overseas as an unqualified teacher, you'll need [qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) to teach in a maintained school in England.

If you're experienced and have a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the [assessment only](/guidance/become-a-teacher-in-england/#assessment-only-candidates-already-working-in-school) route without any further training.

If you have fewer than 2 years of teaching experience, you can get qualified on a teacher training course(https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk).

## Improving the lives of teachers

A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years.

The Department of Education has worked with schools to:

* [reduce the hours teachers work](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-survey-2019)
* [develop a workload reduction kit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit)
* [invest £10m through Behaviour Hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs) so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with other schools that want and need to improve behaviour
* increase [flexible working opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools) for teachers

You can search for jobs with flexible working patterns by using [Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).
