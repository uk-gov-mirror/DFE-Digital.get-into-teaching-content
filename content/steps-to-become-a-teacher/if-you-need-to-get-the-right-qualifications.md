<h2 id="if-you-dont-have-a-degree">If you don’t have a degree</h2>

<p>You’ll need to apply for an initial teacher training (ITT) course that will give you qualified teacher status (QTS). Courses usually take 3 to 4 years and include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><span>Bachelor of Education degree (BEd)</span></li>
  <li><span>Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) with QTS</span></li>
  </ul>

<p>Search <a href="https://digital.ucas.com/search" target="_blank">UCAS</a> to find a degree with QTS.</p>

<h2 id="if-your-degree-is-not-in-the-subject-you-want-to-teach">If your degree is not in the subject you want to teach</h2>

<p>If you need to top up your knowledge of the subject you want to teach, you could take a subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE).</p> 
  
 <p>An SKE may be right for you if:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><span>your degree is not in the subject you want to teach, but is related</span></li>
  <li><span>you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level</span></li>
  <li><span>you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional experience in the subject</span></li>
  <li><span>it’s been some time since you used your degree knowledge</span></li>
  </ul>

<p>If you want more information, read the <a href="">UK government guidance on SKE courses</a>.</p>

<h3>School Direct salaried places</h3>

<p>You’ll earn a salary while you train and you will not pay tuition fees. These places are usually given to graduates with at least 3 years’ work experience.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship</h3>

<p>Postgraduate teaching apprenticeships are similar to school direct salaried places. You’ll be employed by a school to learn on the job over 4 terms. You’ll then take an assessment. This is a salaried training place so you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

<h3>Teach First</h3>

<p>You’ll need to have a 2:1 degree or higher to apply for a place. You’ll train over 2 years by learning on the job. You’ll be paid as an unqualified teacher and you will not pay tuition fees.</p>

<h3>Researchers in schools</h3>

<p>You’ll need (or be about to finish) a doctorate in the subject you want to teach. You’ll then train over 3 years with a bursary. If you have a lot of relevant work experience you could train and earn a salary.</p>

<h3>Assessment only (AO)</h3>

<p>If you’re a teaching assistant or unqualified teacher with two years’ experience you can be assessed over 12 weeks to get QTS. This way of getting QTS will not give you a PGCE. You’ll only need a PGCE if you want to do a master’s qualification or teach outside the UK.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT)</h3>

<p>A number of postgraduate Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are available at university or via a school-led route – all lead to Early Years Teacher Status (EYTS) on successful completion. EYTS is different to QTS in that you specialise in working with children up to five years old only.</p>
